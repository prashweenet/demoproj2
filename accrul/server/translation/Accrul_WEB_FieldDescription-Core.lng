The available system values are: <USER_ID> - Current user id. <COMPANY> - The users default company. <SYSDATE> - The system date at the execution time. <CURR_TYPE> - Default currency rate type for the current company with respect to the base currency. <BASE_CURRENCY> - Base currency for the current company.If "<COMPANY>" is specified, then at runtime the current default company (for the current user) will be used as the default value.Note that when the company-related default values, "<CURR_TYPE>" and "<BASE_CURRENCY>" are evaluated, the company must be known. Company is normally specified via another parameter. How the system values are evaluated depends on the implementation for each file type. For system-defined file types, a special method will be registered during installation/upgrade that can take care of the default parameter value evaluation via the parameter IDs and the specified default values. In this case, the parameter representing company (it usually has parameter ID "COMPANY"), is given the default value "<COMPANY>" or is given a fixed default value. In either case, the specific method will understand how to evaluate the value of company before evaluating the value of another parameter such as "<CURR_TYPE>". If the file type is not system-defined, the company must still be known in order to evaluate the default value represented by e.g. "<CURR_TYPE>," but there is no specific file type interface that knows about the parameter identity "COMPANY" and that can take care of the evaluation. The default company for the current user will always be used in this case, regardless if a company specific parameter exists or not.^
